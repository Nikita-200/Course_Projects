# Course_Projects
This repository showcases a few of the course projects I worked on during my Master’s program at UC San Diego.

📘 Courses
CSE 291J — Fairness, Bias, and Transparency in Machine Learning
Taught by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), this course focused on algorithmic fairness, societal impacts of ML systems, and interpretability.

CSE 253 — Machine Learning for Music
Also taught by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), this course explored music modeling and generation using RNNs, LSTMs, and generative models such as VAEs and GANs.
